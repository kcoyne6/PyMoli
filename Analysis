Based upon the average purchase price females spend $.18 more than males. While this may catch your eye at first it is 
important to note that the male purchase total is $1,605.70 more than the female purchase total. This is due to there being 
652 males as opposed to 113 females.

The largest age demographic is 20-24 year olds, which accounts for 41.67% of users. Next is the age group 15-19, which 
accounts for 25.64% of users. From this we can understand that more than half of the users are aged 15-24.

The average total purchase per person never crosses the $5 threshold. While this is relevant to the average total purchase
per age group, this does not apply to the total purchases per player. Of the total players, 131 players spent $5 or more.
